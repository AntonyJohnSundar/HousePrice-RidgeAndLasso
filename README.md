## General Information

### Problem Statement
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. 
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

- How well those variables describe the price of a house.


### Business Requirment:
To model the price of houses with the available independent variables and to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables.

### Given Data 

- House Price csv file 
- Dictionary file to understand the variables


## Technologies Used

Python Libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib.pyplot
- sklearn
- statsmodel
- Ridge and Lasso Regularization


## Conclusions

- We have built the model using Ridge and Lasso Regression

- We have selected the Model using Lasso Regression with optimal alpha =0.001 as our final model

- We have identified the top significant variables from the Final model
